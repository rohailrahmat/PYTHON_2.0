# # Variable in Python
# # In Python, a variable is used to store data or values that can be used later in the program.
# # Variables can hold different types of data, such as strings, numbers, lists, etc.
# # Here, we have created a variable named 'box' and assigned it a string value describing what a variable is in Python.
# # You can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the '=' operator.
# lists = "represent the collection of items in Python"
# dictionaries = "represent the key-value pairs in Python"
# tuples = "represent the ordered, immutable collection of items in Python"
# sets = "represent the unordered collection of unique items in Python"
# functions = "represent reusable blocks of code in Python"
# comments = "represent the notes or explanations in the code in Python"
# arrays = "represent the collection of items of the same type in Python"
# variables = "represent the storage containers for data in Python"
# modules = "represent the files containing Python code in Python"
# strings = "represent the words or the text data in Python"
# numbers =  "represent the numeric values in Python"
# floats = "represent the decimal values in Python"
# booleans = "represent the True or False values in Python"
# null_value = "represent the absence of a value in Python"

# box = "A variable in Python is a named location used to store data in the memory."

# defintion_of_variable = box

# print(defintion_of_variable)

# a = 5
# b = 10
# addition = a + b
# print(addition)
# # this is  a str in python 
# strings = "rohail rahmat is a string"
# #  this is a number in python
# numbers = 333333333  
# # this is a float in python
# float = 3.14 
# # this is a Null value in py
# null = None

# Name = "Rohail"
# print(Name[0])
# print(Name[1])
# print(Name[2])
